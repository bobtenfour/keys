# Key Inventory ERD

## Authority
This document is the logical data model authority.

## Purpose
Define the logical entities and relationships required by the domain. It is not a database migration plan.

## Initial Logical Entities
- KeyAsset
- KeySeries
- KeyType
- Lock
- Location
- Party
- Loan
- Return
- LifecycleState
- LifecycleTransition
- EventStream
- Event
- EventType
- KeyLifecycleProjection
- CustodyEvent
- CustodyEndpointType
- StorageLocation
- KeyCustodyProjection
- AuditEvent
- InventorySession
- InventoryCount
- InventoryDiscrepancy
- MaintenanceRequest

## Entity Ownership Matrix

| Location | Location boundary | key-inventory-domain-contract.md | Authoritative | Current baseline |
| Party | Party boundary | key-inventory-domain-contract.md | Authoritative | Current baseline |
| Loan | Loan aggregate | key-inventory-domain-contract.md | Authoritative for loan issuance intent and completion workflow, not possession | Current baseline |

| InventorySession | Inventory boundary | key-inventory-domain-contract.md | Authoritative | Future roadmap slice |
| InventoryCount | Inventory boundary | key-inventory-domain-contract.md | Authoritative | Future roadmap slice |
| InventoryDiscrepancy | Inventory boundary | key-inventory-domain-contract.md | Authoritative | Future roadmap slice |
| MaintenanceRequest | Maintenance boundary | key-inventory-domain-contract.md | Authoritative | Future roadmap slice |

## Lifecycle Logical Contract
- LifecycleState preserves the valid derived lifecycle states: Available, Reserved, Issued, InTransit, ReturnedPendingInspection, Lost, Maintenance, Disabled, and Destroyed.
- EventType preserves the core lifecycle event concepts: KeyCreated, KeyUpdated, Issued, Returned, CustodyTransferred, Lost, Recovered, and Destroyed.
- EventStream and Event are append-only lifecycle authority.
- LifecycleTransition is the authority for valid lifecycle transition rules.
- KeyLifecycleProjection is derived from authoritative lifecycle events, rebuildable, and non-authoritative.
- KeyAsset must not contain an authoritative mutable lifecycle status.

## Custody Logical Contract
- CustodyEvent is append-only custody authority.
- Custody transfers support Party and StorageLocation endpoints.
- CustodyEndpointType defines the supported endpoint vocabulary for custody transfers.
- A custody transfer source and destination cannot be identical.
- Current possession is derived from the latest valid CustodyEvent.
- KeyCustodyProjection is derived from authoritative custody events, rebuildable, and non-authoritative.
- Loan, Return, KeyAsset, StorageDevice, reports, and UI must not own current-custodian authority.
- This ERD defines no second possession model.

## Projection Contract
All projection entities are derived, rebuildable, and non-authoritative. They may never be manually edited or become fallback business authority.

This rule applies to:
- KeyLifecycleProjection.
- KeyCustodyProjection.
- LoanProjection if introduced later.
- AuthorizationProjection if introduced later.
- Reporting and BI projections.

## Deferred Concepts
- Lifecycle and custody concepts remain governed by key-inventory-domain-contract.md.
- Future-phase entities from the broader conceptual model remain governed by the roadmap and must be expanded only in their owning future slices.
- This ERD represents only the minimum logical model required for the current baseline to remain internally coherent.

## Rules
- Logical model only.
- No provider-specific database types.
- No EF-specific mapping.
- No migration sequencing.
- Relationships must reflect business meaning.
- Derived values must not become independent authority.
- Each logical entity has exactly one owning aggregate or architectural boundary.
- No entity ownership cycle is allowed.

## Depends On
- key-inventory-domain-contract.md
- project-erd-governance.md

## Depended On By
- slices that implement persistence or domain entities
